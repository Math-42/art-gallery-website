		"description": "Largely forgotten today, De Lairesse was celebrated in his lifetime as a painter and advocate for an idealizing manner based on the study of classical antiquity. This work, likely destined to hang over the mantelpiece in a grand Amsterdam home, depicts the sun god consorting with the goddess of the dawn, a popular subject in French and Italian painting at the time. The attractively individualized young faces have led to speculation that they may be disguised portraits of a newly married couple.",

			"name": "Gerard de Lairesse",
			"description": "Originally from Liege, artist Gerard de Lairesse (1641-1711) came to Amsterdam in 1667. Rembrandt was a major influence at first; later, he became interested in French neoclassical art. He applied these new ideas to his work, mainly painting themes from Antiquity in a clear style. De Lairesse produced numerous wall hangings and ceiling paintings on canvas featuring deceptively realistc trompe-l'oeil scenes. After De Lairesse lost his sight around 1690, he concentrated on art theory. The blind artist gave lectures, which he published in two volumes: Grondlegginge der teekenkonst (1701; translated as A Treatise of the Art of Drawing) and Het groot schilderboeck (1707; translated as The Principles of Drawing). Lairesse’s writings had considerable impact in the 18th century, not least on artist Jacob de Wit."

		"year": 1848,
		"description": "Balke visited the North Cape only once, in 1832, but the experience became a touchstone of his imagination for the rest of his life. The tenebrous palette and expressive brushwork seen in this moonlit view are characteristic of Balke’s mature style, which stands in contrast to the more restrained naturalism of his mentor Johan Christian Dahl. When this painting (or another version) was exhibited in Oslo in the fall of 1848, a critic wrote that it \"claims our interest, both for the nature of the subject itself and the singularity of the perception of the chosen moment.\"",

Born on the Norwegian island of Helgøya, he attended art school in Christiania (now Oslo), before studying with painters in Stockholm and Dresden. Balke was one of the very first artists to venture to the far north of his native Norway. In 1832 he visited the distinctive, dramatic and rugged lands of the North Cape, an experience of primal nature so profound that he built his career painting those isolated Arctic Circle seascapes."

		"description": "In this portrait of his cousin Hartogh van Moerkerken with his wife, Sibylla, and their son, Ter Borch broke with convention by depicting the wife on the left—traditionally the superior, and male—side of the panel. The composition is asymmetrical, lopsided, and dynamic, and the young husband’s gesture of showing a pocket watch to his wife gives the portrait an element of storytelling. This emotionally convincing depiction of a nuclear family signals a break with the dynastic imagery of previous generations, although an older tradition persists in the three coats of arms clustered in the upper left-hand corner.",

Probably not long after the death of his mother, Anna Bufken, in 1621, Ter Borch began his training with his father, the draftsman Gerard ter Borch the Elder (1584–1662). He was clearly a precocious pupil: an accomplished drawing he made of a figure seen from behind (Rijksprentenkabinet, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) is dated September 25, 1625, when he was only eight years old."

Lavishly patronized and showered with academic honors throughout his career, Boucher came under harsh criticism later in his life, when his ebullient rococo style was attacked as decorative and his gallant iconography condemned as trivial."

Oil sketches such as this were often the preferred means of conveying information to both the client and the artisans who would craft the object. Boucher masterfully employs monochrome greys, known as grisaille, to suggest stone paired with what might be intended to be gilt bronze.

It originally decorated the bathing apartments (a luxurious suite of three rooms) in Pompadour’s Château de Bellevue. The construction of her château prompted many of the most important commissions of Rococo painting and sculpture. For a subject that became synonymous with both Boucher and Pompadour, the artist devised a summary of the movement’s key features: overt theatricality, voluptuous flesh, and an asymmetrical unfurling of luxurious furniture, fabric, flowers, and pearls.",

The Salon picture was purchased by Napoleon III for his personal collection. In 1875, New Yorker John Wolfe commissioned the present, slightly smaller, replica from Cabanel. The composition embodies ideals of academic art: mythological subject, graceful modeling, silky brushwork, and perfected form. This style was perennially popular with collectors, even as it was challenged by artists seeking a more personal interpretation of truth to nature, such as Courbet.",

Unable to communicate with the man she loves, Echo retreats to the mountains and pines away until just her voice remains. This painting depicts the nymph with her mouth agape and her hands at her ears as if startled by reverberating sounds. The mannered elegance and polished handling of the figure epitomize the style promoted by the influential French Académie des Beaux-Arts. Nineteenth-century critics often deemed such idealized portrayals of the nude unconvincing, but many viewers preferred them to more realistic depictions, which seemed shockingly indecorous.",
